paragraph=''' A MIDSUMMER-NIGHT'S DREAM





Come on , sir ; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding .

I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught . I know my business is but to the court .

To the court ! why what place make you special , when you put off that with such contempt ? 'But to the court !' 

Truly , madam , if God have lent a man any manners , he may easily put it off at court : he that cannot make a leg , put off's cap , kiss his hand , and say nothing , has neither leg , hands , lip , nor cap ; and indeed such a fellow , to say precisely , were not for the court . But , for me , I have an answer will serve all men .

Marry , that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions .

It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks ; the pin-buttock , the quatch-buttock , the brawn-buttock , or any buttock .

Will your answer serve fit to all questions ?

As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney , as your French crown for your taffeta punk , as Tib's rush for Tom's forefinger , as a pancake for Shrove-Tuesday , a morris for Mayday , as the nail to his hole , the cuckold to his horn , as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave , as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth ; nay , as the pudding to his skin .

Have you , I say , an answer of such fitness for all questions ?

From below your duke to beneath your constable , it will fit any question .

It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands .

But a trifle neither , in good faith , if the learned should speak truth of it . Here it is , and all that belongs to't : ask me if I am a courtier ; it shall do you no harm to learn .

To be young again , if we could . I will be a fool in question , hoping to be the wiser by your answer . I pray you , sir , are you a courtier ?

O Lord , sir ! there's a simple putting off . More , more , a hundred of them .

Sir , I am a poor friend of yours , that loves you .

O Lord , sir ! Thick , thick , spare not me .

I think , sir , you can eat none of this homely meat .

O Lord , sir ! Nay , put me to't , I warrant you .

You were lately whipped , sir , as I think .

O Lord , sir ! Spare not me .

Do you cry , 'O Lord , sir !' at your whipping , and 'Spare not me ?' Indeed your 'O Lord , sir !' is very sequent to your whipping : you would answer very well to a whipping , if you were but bound to't .

I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord , sir !' I see things may serve long , but not serve ever .

I play the noble housewife with the time ,
To entertain't so merrily with a fool .

O Lord , sir ! why , there't serves well again .

An end , sir : to your business . Give Helen this ,
And urge her to a present answer back :
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son .
This is not much .

Not much commendation to them .

Not much employment for you : you understand me ?

Most fruitfully : I am there before my legs .

Haste you again .


They say miracles are past ; and we have our philosophical persons , to make modern and familiar , things supernatural and causeless . Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors , ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge , when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear .

Why , 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times .

And so 'tis .

To be relinquished of the artists ,

So I say .

Both of Galen and Paracelsus .

So I say .

Of all the learned and authentic fellows ,

Right ; so I say .

That gave him out incurable ,

Why , there 'tis ; so say I too .

Not to be helped ,

Right ; as 'twere , a man assured of a 

Uncertain life , and sure death .

Just , you say well : so would I have said .

I may truly say it is a novelty to the world .

It is , indeed : if you will have it in showing , you shall read it in what do you call there 

A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor .

That's it I would have said ; the very same .

Why , your dolphin is not lustier : 'fore me , I speak in respect 

Nay , 'tis strange , 'tis very strange , that is the brief and the tedious of it ; and he is of a most facinorous spirit , that will not acknowledge it to be the 

Very hand of heaven 

Ay , so I say .

In a most weak and debile minister , great power , great transcendence : which should , indeed , give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the king , as to be generally thankful .

I would have said it ; you say well . Here comes the king .


Lustig , as the Dutchman says : I'll like a maid the better , whilst I have a tooth in my head . Why , he's able to lead her a coranto .

Mort du vinaigre ! Is not this Helen ?

'Fore God , I think so .

Go , call before me all the lords in court .

Sit , my preserver , by thy patient's side :
And with this healthful hand , whose banish'd sense 
Thou hast repeal'd , a second time receive 
The confirmation of my promised gift ,
Which but attends thy naming .


Fair maid , send forth thine eye : this youthful parcel 
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing ,
O'er whom both sov'reign power and father's voice 
I have to use : thy frank election make ;

Thou hast power to choose , and they none to forsake .

To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress 
Fall , when Love please ! marry , to each , but one .

I'd give bay Curtal , and his furniture ,
My mouth no more were broken than these boys' 
And writ as little beard .

Peruse them well :
Not one of those but had a noble father .

Gentlemen ,
Heaven hath through me restor'd the king to health .

We understand it , and thank heaven for you .

I am a simple maid ; and therein wealthiest 
That I protest I simply am a maid .
Please it your majesty , I have done already :
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me ,
'We blush , that thou shouldst choose ; but , be refus'd ,
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever ;
We'll ne'er come there again .' 

Make choice ; and see ,
Who shuns thy love , shuns all his love in me .

Now , Dian , from thy altar do I fly ,
And to imperial Love , that god most high ,
Do my sighs stream . Sir , will you hear my suit ?

And grant it .

Thanks , sir ; all the rest is mute .

I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life .

The honour , sir , that flames in your fair eyes ,
Before I speak , too threateningly replies :
Love make your fortunes twenty times above 
Her that so wishes , and her humble love !

No better , if you please .

My wish receive ,
Which great Love grant ! and so I take my leave .

Do all they deny her ? An they were sons of mine , I'd have them whipp'd or I would send them to the Turk to make eunuchs of .

Be not afraid that I your hand should take ;
I'll never do you wrong for your own sake :
Blessing upon your vows ! and in your bed 
Find fairer fortune , if you ever wed !

These boys are boys of ice , they'll none have her : sure , they are bastards to the English ; the French ne'er got 'em .

You are too young , too happy , and too good ,
To make yourself a son out of my blood .

Fair one , I think not so .

There's one grape yet . I am sure thy father drunk wine . But if thou be'st not an ass , I am a youth of fourteen : I have known thee already .

I dare not say I take you ; but I give 
Me and my service , ever whilst I live ,
Into your guiding power . This is the man .

Why then , young Bertram , take her ; she's thy wife .

My wife , my liege ! I shall beseech your highness 
In such a business give me leave to use 
The help of mine own eyes .

Know'st thou not , Bertram ,
What she has done for me ?

Yes , my good lord ;
But never hope to know why I should marry her .

Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed .

But follows it , my lord , to bring me down 
Must answer for your raising ? I know her well :
She had her breeding at my father's charge .
A poor physician's daughter my wife ! Disdain 
Rather corrupt me ever !

'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her , the which 
I can build up . Strange is it that our bloods ,
Of colour , weight , and heat , pour'd all together ,
Would quite confound distinction , yet stand off 
In differences so mighty . If she be 
All that is virtuous , save what thou dislik'st ,
A poor physician's daughter , thou dislik'st 
Of virtue for the name ; but do not so :
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed ,
The place is dignified by the doer's deed :
Where great additions swell's , and virtue none ,
It is a dropsied honour . Good alone 
Is good without a name : vileness is so :
The property by what it is should go ,
Not by the title . She is young , wise , fair ;
In these to nature she's immediate heir ,
And these breed honour : that is honour's scorn 
Which challenges itself as honour's born ,
And is not like the sire : honours thrive 
When rather from our acts we them derive 
Than our foregoers . The mere word's a slave ,
Debosh'd on every tomb , on every grave 
A lying trophy , and as oft is dumb 
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb 
Of honour'd bones indeed . What should be said ?
If thou canst like this creature as a maid ,
I can create the rest : virtue and she 
Is her own dower ; honour and wealth from me .

I cannot love her , nor will strive to do't .

Thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose .

That you are well restor'd , my lord , I'm glad :
Let the rest go .

My honour's at the stake , which to defeat 
I must produce my power . Here , take her hand ,
Proud scornful boy , unworthy this good gift ,
That dost in vile misprision shackle up 
My love and her desert ; thou canst not dream 
We , poising us in her defective scale ,
Shall weigh thee to the beam ; that wilt not know ,
It is in us to plant thine honour where 
We please to have it grow . Check thy contempt :
Obey our will , which travails in thy good :
Believe not thy disdain , but presently 
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right 
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims ;
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever 
Into the staggers and the careless lapse 
Of youth and ignorance ; both my revenge and hate 
Loosing upon thee , in the name of justice ,
Without all terms of pity . Speak ; thine answer .

Pardon , my gracious lord ; for I submit 
My fancy to your eyes . When I consider 
What great creation and what dole of honour 
Flies where you bid it , I find that she , which late 
Was in my nobler thoughts most base , is now 
The praised of the king ; who , so ennobled ,
Is , as 'twere , born so .

Take her by the hand ,
And tell her she is thine : to whom I promise 
A counterpoise , if not to thy estate 
A balance more replete .

I take her hand .

Good fortune and the favour of the king 
Smile upon this contract ; whose ceremony 
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief ,
And be perform'd to-night : the solemn feast 
Shall more attend upon the coming space ,
Expecting absent friends . As thou lov'st her ,
Thy love's to me religious ; else , does err .


Do you hear , monsieur ? a word with you .

Your pleasure , sir ?



I pray you , stay not , but in haste to horse .

I shall not break your bidding , good my lord .

Farewell .

Go thou toward home ; where I will never come 
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum .
Away ! and for our flight .

Bravely , coragio !

So that from point to point now have you heard 
The fundamental reasons of this war ,
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth ,
And more thirsts after .

Holy seems the quarrel 
Upon your Grace's part ; black and fearful 
On the opposer .

Therefore we marvel much our cousin France 
Would in so just a business shut his bosom 
Against our borrowing prayers .

Good my lord ,
The reasons of our state I cannot yield ,
But like a common and an outward man ,
That the great figure of a council frames 
By self-unable motion : therefore dare not 
Say what I think of it , since I have found 
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail 
As often as I guess'd .

Be it his pleasure .

But I am sure the younger of our nature ,
That surfeit on their ease , will day by day 
Come here for physic .

Welcome shall they be ,
And all the honours that can fly from us 
Shall on them settle . You know your places well ;
When better fall , for your avails they fell .
To-morrow to the field .


It hath happened all as I would have had it , save that he comes not along with her .

By my troth , I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man .

By what observance , I pray you ?

Why , he will look upon his boot and sing ; mend the ruff and sing ; ask questions and sing ; pick his teeth and sing . I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song .

Let me see what he writes , and when he means to come .

I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court . Our old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court : the brains of my Cupid's knocked out , and I begin to love , as an old man loves money , with no stomach .

What have we here ?

E'en that you have there .


I have sent you a daughter-in-law : she hath recovered the king , and undone me . I have wedded her , not bedded her ; and sworn to make the 'not' eternal . You shall hear I am ran away : know it before the report come . If there be breadth enough in the world , I will hold a long distance . My duty to you .
Your unfortunate son ,
This is not well : rash and unbridled boy ,
To fly the favours of so good a king !
To pluck his indignation on thy head 
By the misprising of a maid too virtuous 
For the contempt of empire !'''

I shall obey his will .
You must not marvel , Helen , at my course ,
Which holds not colour with the time , nor does 
The ministration and required office 
On my particular : prepar'd I was not 
For such a business ; therefore am I found 
So much unsettled . This drives me to entreat you 
That presently you take your way for home ;
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you ;
For my respects are better than they seem ,
And my appointments have in them a need 
Greater than shows itself at the first view 
To you that know them not . This to my mother .

I would not tell you what I would , my lord :

Strangers and foes do sunder , and not kiss .

I pray you , stay not , but in haste to horse .

I shall not break your bidding , good my lord .

Farewell .
